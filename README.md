# Server - Client Demo App With Java

It is a project that aims to demonstrate server-client communication by opening a TCP Socket with Java.

You can think of it as if it is a group chat application. Clients connect to the server and start sending and receiving messages. Messages sent by all clients go to each other. Multi-thread approach has been taken into account.
